# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Transformer Models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT)

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using various state-of-the-art transformer models such as **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, **XLNet**, and **DistilBERT**. The aim is to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of tweets using these models and to compare their performances.

### Key Features:
- Multiple transformer models for sentiment classification: BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing to handle text cleaning, tokenization, and encoding.
- Use of **heatmaps** and **word maps** to explain sentiment outcomes and important terms.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall to compare model performance.
  
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from [Kaggle - Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis).

It contains labeled Twitter data with entities and corresponding sentiment labels. We’ve used this data to train and evaluate the transformer models on the task of sentiment analysis.

## Models Used

1. **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
2. **RoBERTa** (Robustly optimized BERT approach)
3. **XLNet** (Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding)
4. **DistilBERT** (Smaller and faster version of BERT)

Each model was fine-tuned on the dataset to classify tweets into three categories:
- **Positive**
- **Negative**
- **Neutral**

## Data Preprocessing

The following steps were performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis:
- Removal of URLs, mentions (@username), hashtags, and special characters.
- Lowercasing and tokenization.
- Encoding of labels for model training.
  
## Visualizations

- **Heatmaps**: Generated to visualize model performance across different sentiment classes, showcasing confusion matrices and highlighting model accuracy for each class.
  
- **Word Maps**: Generated to illustrate frequently occurring words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets, providing better insights into the text data.




## Usage

You can use this repository to train your sentiment analysis models on Twitter data. It allows you to fine-tune the models and visualize the results. Check the notebooks for detailed implementations and explanations.
